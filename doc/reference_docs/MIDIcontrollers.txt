MIDI Controllers now mapped to OSC and vice versa.

Here is our scheme for assigning MIDIcontroller to the parameter.
This is a hint likely to be changed in future, when a edit window for the maopping
will be realized.

Anyhow we prefer OSC-control to MIDI in future.

Most controls are grouped in 8th in one channel. If more are used we use the next MIDI-Channel.

e.g.::
	1 FADER_GAIN: 105, ch 1
	2 FADER_GAIN: 106, ch 1
        ...
	9 FADER_GAIN: 105, ch 2

So here the actual numbers where $1 is the channel number:

$1_IN_FADER_GAIN: 105-112
$1 IN_SOLO		: 65-72
$1_IN_ON	: 73-80
$1 IN_SELECT	: 33-40
$1_IN_LFC_GAIN	: 1-8
$1_IN_AMBI_AZM	: 97-104
$1_IN_AMBI_ELV	: 89-96
$1_IN_AMBI_RAD	: 81-88

$1_OUT_BUS_GAIN : 113-120
OUT_AMBI_GAIN	: 121
$1_OUT_LFC_GAIN	: 122-123
OUT_MASTER_GAIN	: 124

EXT_REV_MASTER_VOL: 125
EXT_RRR_MASTER_VOL: 126


Please note: MIDI is limited in transmission over MIDI-cables so on fast updates it is easy to
overload a MIDI-connection with the CUBEmixer.


Controller in CUBE are The BC{F,r}2000.
