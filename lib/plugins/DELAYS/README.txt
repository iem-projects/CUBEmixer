DELAYS - Plugin for CUBEMixer 
Version: 0.1
IEM - winfried ritsch

DELAYS is a simple plugin to delay input channels in groups up to 1 min.

This was needed for streaming event, to synchronize video with a much greater  delay, up to 1 min,
to audio. In this case  OGGstream (OGGamp extension) and jacktripp was used.

Therefore PLUGINS can be grouped with grouping numbers, so each change of one parameter also changes 
the others.

Parameter:

 - delay time in ms.
 - grouping on off
 - group number (if grouping enabled)


NOTE: Not tested very much, grouping function was deactivated until final release.
