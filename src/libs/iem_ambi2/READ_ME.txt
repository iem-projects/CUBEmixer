This library extends the performance of miller puckette's pure data (pd).

iem_ambi2 is written by Thomas Musil from IEM Graz Austria
 and it is compatible to miller puckette's pd-0.37-3 to pd-0.40-2.
see also LICENCE.txt, GnuGPL.txt.

iem_ambi2 contains 5 objects:

"ambi2_encode", "ambi2_decode", "ambi2_rotate",
"ambi2_encode_hemi", "ambi2_decode_hemi".

They calculate ambisonic encoder matrices, rotation matrices and
decoder matrices in 2D and 3D. They were tested up to 19th order. "hemi" is for half-circle or half-sphere loudspeaker-layouts.
ambisonic is a 3D sound spatialisation system with separated encoding and decoding.
(based on spherical harmonics).
