pd-externals needed for CUBEmixer

following pd-externals are needed for the CUBEmixer to run correctly:
 aconnect (linux)
 iemgui
 iem_ambi
 iemlib
 iemmatrix
 popup
 zexy

All of these externals (with the notable exception of iemgui) 
are not included with this package!

The missing externals are available from the pure-data CVS-repository 
hosted by SourceForge.
You can get them via:
sh~> cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net/projects/pure-data login
(when asked for a password, just hit return)
sh~> cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net/projects/pure-data co externals


Linux:

To ease the installation, you can run "make" in this directory.
This should download all needed externals, compile them and install them into
a place where CUBEmixer will look for them.
Since some externals rely on the full pd-sources, you will have to give the
full path to your pd sources.
Use something like
sh~> make PDSOURCES=/path/to/sources/of/pd/src
